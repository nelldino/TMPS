#  Laboratory work 1 - Creational Design Patterns

### Author: Nelli Garbuz

## Task:

1. Study and understand the Creational Design Patterns.

2. Choose a domain, define its main classes/models/entities and choose the appropriate instantiation mechanisms.

3. Use some creational design patterns for object instantiation in a sample project.

## Theory

Creational Design Patterns focus on the process of object creation or problems related to object creation. They help in making a system independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented. Creational patterns give a lot of flexibility in what gets created, who creates it, and how it gets created. There are two main themes in these patterns:

* They keep information about the specific classes used in the system hidden.
* They hide the details of how instances of these classes are created and assembled. [1]

The Creational Design Patterns are: [2]

* Factory Method - provides an interface for crating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of the objects that will be created
* Abstract Method - Lets one to produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes
* Builder - lets one to construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code
* Prototype - lets one copy existing objects without making code dependent on their classes
* Singleton - ensure that class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance

## Implementation description

In my project I implemented 3 Creational Patterns - Singleton, Factory Method and Builder.

I decided to make an Art Gallery Management System, where a user can:

* Add artworks (paintings or sculptures)
* Display all the artworks from the gallery
* Search for a specific artwork (by title or author)
*
